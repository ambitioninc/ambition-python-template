Running the tests
-----------------

Once you have cloned the source code, you can run the code quality and unit
tests by running::

    $ git clone git://github.com/ambitioninc/{{ repo_name }}.git
    $ cd {{ repo_name }}
    $ virtualenv env
    $ . env/bin/activate
    $ python setup.py install
    $ pip install -r requirements/test.txt
    $ nosetests --cover-branches --with-coverage --cover-min-percentage=100 --cover-package={{ package_name }}

While 100% code coverage does not make a library bug-free, it significantly
reduces the number of easily caught bugs! Please make sure coverage is at 100%
before submitting a pull request!

Code Quality
------------

For code quality, please run flake8::

    $ flake8 . --max-line-length=120 --max-complexity=10 --exclude='docs,env,*.egg'

Code Styling
------------
Please arrange imports with the following style::

    # Standard library imports
    import os

    # Third party package imports
    from mock import patch

    # Local package imports
    from {{ package_name }}.version import __version__

Please follow `Google's python style`_ guide wherever possible.

-----------------

When in the project directory::

    $ pip uninstall -y {{ repo_name }} && python setup.py install
    $ cd docs
    $ make html
    $ open docs/_build/html/index.html
